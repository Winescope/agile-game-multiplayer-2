   - Sign up/Login with your GitHub account
   - Click "New +" and select "Blueprint"

3. **Deploy:**
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file
   - Click "Apply" to deploy both services

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

#### Backend Deployment

1. **Create a new Web Service:**
   - Name: `agile-game-backend`
   - Environment: `Node`
   - Build Command: `cd server && npm install`
   - Start Command: `cd server && npm start`

2. **Deploy**

#### Frontend Deployment

1. **Create a new Static Site:**
   - Name: `agile-game-frontend`
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `dist`

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - `VITE_WS_URL`: `wss://your-backend-url.onrender.com`

3. **Deploy**

### Update Frontend URL

After deployment, update the WebSocket URL in `src/App.tsx`:

```typescript
const WS_URL = 'wss://your-backend-url.onrender.com';
```

## Game Rules

### Session 1: Individual Work
- Players work individually on tickets
- Each player has their own dice and tickets
- Goal: Complete as many tickets as possible

### Session 2: Collaborative Work
- Players can help each other with tickets
- Multiple players can work on the same ticket
- Goal: Improve team collaboration and efficiency

### Ticket Types
- **Normal**: Standard tickets (6 points each phase)
- **Urgent**: Must be completed quickly
- **Fixed Date**: Must be completed by round 10

### Blockers
- Tickets can get blocked during gameplay
- Blockers require 4 points to resolve
- Only dice values 4, 5, or 6 can be used on blockers

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, WebSocket
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Deployment**: Render
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket
